# ZynKid Principles

ZynKid is an independent learning platform designed for children.

The platform is intentionally built around limits, structure, and calm interaction.
We do not optimize for engagement loops, infinite generation, or attention extraction.

Core principles:
- Child safety over capability
- Structure over chaos
- Limits over excess
- Depth over speed
- Creativity with boundaries

These principles guide all product and technical decisions at ZynKid.
